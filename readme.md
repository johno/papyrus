__Work in progress__

A minimalist browser built for readability.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnotander/papyrus.git && cd $_
npm i
npm start
```

## Usage

Papyrus looks for a `.papyrus.js` in your home directory.
It can be used to specify a style object that will be applied to all sites.
You can also use other packages to provide values like a [typescale](https://github.com/johnotander/diatonic).

```javascript
const diatonic = require('diatonic')

{
  baseFontSize: '18px'
  typescale: diatonic(),
  width: '32rem',
}
```
